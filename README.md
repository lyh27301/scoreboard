# scoreboard

## Project
This project simulated an interactive scoreboard. The display of total scores and total players change automatically according to user operation on each player panel. Users can operate on the scoreboard to add/delete players, manipulate scores, and click on buttons of stopwatch widgets to start and reset the stopwatch at any time.

- PureComponent was extended by the Player component for performance boost.
- Imported PropType library for props' type validation.
- Refs for dynamically accessing input value. 
- Props were properly destructed into separate variables.
